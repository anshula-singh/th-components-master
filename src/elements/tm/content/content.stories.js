    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      Learning objectives are a great way to summarize expectations to users.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the vision for what content look like</li>
      <li>Explain the different types of text elements used in a unit</li>
      <li>Explain how to properly use each text element</li>
      <li>
        Use text elements to create content that is easy to read, consumable and
        consistent!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The future is now</h2>

    <p>
      This is "example" content to help visulize the <em>future </em>of units,
      documentation, blogs and any other type of content in Trailhead. This unit
      will present all text elements available and guidelines for use. If I
      (Cameron) have forgotten one, please let me know! Also, please forgive the
      many spelling errors.
    </p>

    <!-- HEADINGS -->
    <h2>Headings (h1, h2, h3)</h2>

    <p>
      Heading are foundational. Proper usage of headings is essential to good
      accessibility and readability. All h2 headings are autogenerated in the
      table of contents in the sidebar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technically only 2 levels of headings are supported: h2 & h3. Anything
      beyond h3 <strong>should not be used</strong> and the content should
      instead be broken into higher level sections. (If you happen to use an
      h4-h6, it will be styled the same as an h3).
    </p>
    <p>
      H1 is used only for the title (Use the Page Header component). There
      should only be <strong>one</strong> h1 per page.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><h2>Headings 2</h2></dt>
      <dd>
        H2's are the most common header used to devide content sections into
        bite sized chunks.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt><h3>Headings 3</h3></dt>
      <dd>
        H3's are used to create additional sections and
        <strong>should only be used if contained within an h2</strong>.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      Remember! Do not include text styling like <em>em</em>,
      <strong>strong</strong>, <samp>samp</samp>, <a>a</a>, <kbd>kbd</kbd>, etc.
      within a header.
    </p>

    <!-- PARAGRAPHS -->
    <h2>Paragraphs (p)</h2>

    <p>
      Paragraphs make up the bulk of content (obvs). They are the bread and
      butter. In general, paragraphs should be chunked into readible sections.
      P.S. Emojis are cool to add sometimes, but please dont over due it! ðŸ™Œ
    </p>

    <!-- TEXT STYLING -->
    <h2>Text Styling</h2>

    <p>
      Paragraphs often contain many text styling to provide emphasis or provide
      clarity. Remember! You should use correct semantics.
      <strong
        >Do not use tags to achieve certain styling that does not fit proper
        usage</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><em>em, i</em></dt>
      <dd>
        Renders as italic text. This is used for a subtle emphasis of a word or
        statement. For example: "It is <em>recommended</em> you save at this
        point."
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>strong, b</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Renders as bold text. This is used for a bold emphasis of a word or
        statement. For example: "It is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> you
        save at this point."
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <code>code</code>
      <dd>
        Defines a piece of computer code you want to display inline. For
        example: "The following code will start the robot:
        <code>function Panel(element, canClose, closeHandler)</code>"
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt><samp>samp</samp></dt>
      <dd>
        Defines text that should be interpreted as sample output from an app.
        For example: "After clicking enter, you should recive the message:
        <samp>File Not Found! Please Contact Support.</samp>"
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt><kbd>kbd</kbd></dt>
      <dd>
        Defines keyboard input or menu selection. For example: "Click
        <kbd>File</kbd> in the menu." or "For Field Label, enter
        <kbd>Technical Site</kbd>."
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <var>var</var>
      <dd>
        Should be used for variables in a mathematical expression or code. For
        example: "The volume of a box is <var>l</var> Ã— <var>w</var> Ã—
        <var>h</var>, where <var>l</var> represents the length, <var>w</var> the
        width and <var>h</var> the height of the box.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt><dfn>dfn</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
        Defines an inline term within a paragraph. For example: "A
        <dfn>validator</dfn> is a program that checks for syntax errors in code
        or documents."
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt><del>del, s</del> & <ins>ins</ins></dt>
      <dd>
        This formatting is acceptable if we need to archive previously displayed
        text. It should <strong>almost always</strong> be followed by
        <code>&lt;ins&gt;</code>. For example: "This great features is planning
        to be released <del>Winter '19</del> <ins>Winter '20</ins>."
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt><abbr title="Abbreviation">abbr</abbr></dt>
      <dd>
        Used to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym. If if you use
        <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code>, you <strong>must</strong> provide a full
        expansion of the term with a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> attribute. For
        example: "We use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to
        structure our web documents."
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt><sup>sup</sup> & <sub>sub</sub></dt>
      <dd>
        Occasionally you may need to use superscript and subscript when marking
        up items like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so
        they have the correct meaning. The <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> elements handle this job. For example: "My
        birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001. Caffeine's chemical
        formula is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>."
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        <small>small</small>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Represents small print like copyright and legal text. This should rarely
        be used. For example:
        <p>
          <small
            >Copyright: Rights of ALBERT EINSTEIN are used with permission of
            The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Represented exclusively by
            Greenlight.</small
          >
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        <mark>mark</mark>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Mark highlights text for reference or notation purposes. Highlighted
        text is pretty aggressive so <em>please</em> just use
        <strong>strong</strong>.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        <u>underline</u>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Technically this should be used to represend mispelled words. We don't
        misspell words so this should not be used. ðŸ˜€
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <!-- CODE BLOCKS -->
    <h2>Code Blocks</h2>

    <h3>Component (Coming Soon)</h3>
    <p>
      Our code block component brings code samples to life with code highlighted
      in differened colors for readability and actions like copy & paste built
      in.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>
      Technically you could also use <code>pre code</code>. But we would
      recommened using our code block component for richer output
    </p>

    <pre><code>
        function Panel(element, canClose, closeHandler) {
          this.element = element;
          this.canClose = canClose;
          this.closeHandler = function () { if (closeHandler) closeHandler() };
        }
      </code></pre>

    <!-- QUOTES -->
    <h2>Quotes (blockquote & q)</h2>

    <p>
      Quotes are a wonderful way to highlight an important sentance to two of
      the content. We have two quote options to choose from: block quote and
      pull quotes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, it is recommened you include a "cite" for additionaly
      context.
    </p>

    <h3>Component (Coming Soon)</h3>
    <p>
      Our quote component allows you to add a picture of the quote authoer. Cite
      images are cropped to be a perfect circle.
    </p>

    <!-- Block Quote -->
    <h3>HTML Blockquote</h3>
    <p>
      Block quotes are also set off from the main text as a distinct block.
      However, they refer to some external citation which isnâ€™t already
      mentioned in the article. <strong>Do not use a cite.</strong>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      One of the biggest values of 1:1s is discovering where employees are
      struggling or stuck, and helping them find a path forward. Not by telling
      them how you'd do it, but by guiding them to come up with their own
      solution
    </blockquote>

    <!-- Pull Quote -->
    <h3>HTML Pull quotes</h3>
    <p>
      Pull quotes are short excerpts from the presented text. They are used to
      pull a text passage out of the readerâ€™s flow and give it a more dominant
      position in the unit.
    </p>
    <q
      >As a marathon runner, I think of 1:1s as a way to ensure we are aligned
      on the best path to achieve the goal, as well as a point to pick up water
      to hydrate to ensure we are prepared to go the distance."

    <!-- EMBEDDED MEDIA -->
    <h2>Embeded Media</h2>

    <p>
      Media makes units fun and more engaging. There are many types of media
      objects you can include!
    </p>

    <h3>Inline Image Component (Coming Soon)</h3>
    <p>
      Inline images provide an extra visual to help guide users for what they
      are looking for.
    </p>

    <h3>Image</h3>
    <p>
      Images are a great tool to help users visualize the written instructions.
      Large images will span 100% width. Small images will be left aligned. By
      default, a border will be added the image (Do not add borders to your
      image! We will add the border with code.). You can use many different
      types of images like .jpg, .png, .svg and .gif!
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508144753681-9986d4df99b3?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&s=b3cf0ccc6287057b5a71b0ecdd6cf3f4&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1650&q=80"
    />

    <h3>Image with Footnote</h3>
    <p>
      Use captions only when they're absolutely needed for clarity. If clear
      introductions precede graphics or tables, captions aren't needed. Avoid
      using captions for inline graphics or simple icons.
    </p>

    <p>
      When using the <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element, be sure to wrap
      the image with <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>
    </p>

    <h3>YouTube & Vidyard Video Component (Coming Soon)</h3>
    <p>
      Video is a great way to embed interactive content. You can embed YouTube
      or use the Vidyard player.
    </p>

    <!-- LIST -->
    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>
      Lists are great ways to organize information in a clear and structured
      way. We have two lists options to choose from: rdered lists and unordered
      lists (well three, because you can mix and match).
    </p>

    <p>
      Even though you can technically go up to 5 levels, it is
      <strong>best to keep to 3 levels</strong>. Never go more then 5 levels
      deep.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, avoid putting to much media, code boxes, messages, quotes and
      other elaborate elements in a list. It's not a hard rule, but it generally
      looks better.
    </p>

    <!-- Ordered List -->
    <h3>Ordered list</h3>
    <p>
      Ordered list items are marked with numbers or letters. They are perfect to
      use when showing steps or order.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Level one: Step one</li>
      <li>
        Level one: Step two
        <ol>

    <!-- Unordered list -->
    <h3>Unordered list</h3>
    <p>
      Ordered list items are marked with numbers or letters. They are perfect to
      use when showing steps or order.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Level one: Step one</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Mixed -->

    <p>In certain situations, it may make sense to use both.</p>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps using List</h3>
    <p>
      A common pattern is to display steps with supporting visuals like images
      and tables.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Navigation menuâ€”available when you tap Salesforce App Nav from the
        mobile app.
        <img class="img-list" src="https://image.ibb.co/hZ4Fmc/mobile_1.png" />
      </li>

      <li>
        Repeat steps in folders:
        <ul>
          <li>Admin Lightning Experience Reports</li>
          <li>Marketing Reports</li>
          <li>Marketing Reports</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Fill in the folder information: (List item with table)
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Field</th>
              <th>Value</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Email Template Folder Label</td>
              <td>Discount Request Responses</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Folder Unique Name</td>
              <td>(this field auto-populates)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Public Folder access</td>
              <td>Read/Write</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Definition List -->
    <h3>Definition List</h3>
    <p>
      Definition lists are perfect for defining terms. Think like a dictionary.
      Definition lists have been restyled from the past to ensure they are used
      properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be easy to confuse when a definition list should be used vs. an h3.
      In general, reserve dl for a specific and concise definition. Use h3 for a
      more verbose section about a certian topic.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Term 1</dt>
      <dd>Definition</dd>
      <dt>Term 2</dt>
      <dd>Definition</dd>
      <dt>Term 3</dt>
      <dd>Definition</dd>
    </dl>

    <!-- MESSAGE BOXES -->
    <h2>Message Box Component (Coming Soon)</h2>
    <p>Messages are an excellent way to call out something of importance.</p>

    <!-- TABLES -->
    <h2>Tables</h2>
    <p>
      Tables are an arrangement of information in rows and columns containing
      cells that make comparing and contrasting information easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tables should alwasy include a table header (<code>&lt;th&gt;</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, avoid putting media, code boxes, messages, quotes and other
      elaborate elements in a table. It's not a hard rule, but it generally
      looks better.
    </p>

    <h3>Top Header</h3>
    <p>
      The top header should be the default go to for tables. It is the most
      recognizable and easy to consume.
    </p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Function</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>AVG()</td>
          <td>Returns the average value of a numeric field.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>COUNT() and COUNT(fieldName) and COUNT_DISTINCT()</td>
          <td>Returns the number of rows matching the query criteria.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>MIN()</td>
          <td>Returns the minimum value of a field.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>MAX()</td>
          <td>Returns the maximum value of a field.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>SUM()</td>
          <td>Returns the total sum of a numeric field.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Left Header</h3>
    <p>In certain situations, a left header makes more sense.</p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>First Name</th>
          <td>John</td>
          <td>Peter</td>
          <td>John</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Last Name</th>
          <td>Carter</td>
          <td>Parker</td>
          <td>Rambo</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Email</th>
          <td>johncarter@mail.com</td>
          <td>peterparker@mail.com</td>
          <td>johnrambo@mail.com</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Span header</h3>
    <p>
      In certain situations, spanning a header is a good way to organize
      information.
    </p>

    <h3>Footnote</h3>
    <p>
      In general, avoid using table captions. In certain circumstances, captions
      are good to use when you have multiple tables and need to reference them
      to your reader. To add a caption to a table, use the
      <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code> tag.
    </p>

    <table>
      <caption>

    <h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      These guidelines will ultimately help people consume content better.
      Consistency throughout the product will allow our users to feel
      comfortable and familiar with our content. Constraints and rules allow us
      to maintain that consistency. That said, I want us to feel free to evolve
      our patterns to fit the needs of our writers. That includes changing or
      adding new elements.

    <h2>Resources Component (Coming Soon)</h2>
    <p>
      Resources cap the end of content. It should be a simple list of links with
      no levels. Each resource will have an icon (we will have to extreact a few
      from SLDS we would like to use.)
